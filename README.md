# Overview of Project
## Purpose

In this challenge, Dana was tasked with developing a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts the UFO sighting data table. This is done by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page designed using a css and bootstrap styling file. The html file creates a webpage that holds UFO sighting data in a table that is designed to filter based on the following criteria:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

# Results - Using the Search Criteria

1. Open the [index.html](https://github.com/Sborresch/java_script/blob/main/UFOS/index.html) file in VSCode editor
