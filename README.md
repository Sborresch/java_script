# Overview of Project
## Purpose

In this challenge, Dana was tasked with developing a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts the UFO sighting data table. This is done by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page designed using a css and bootstrap styling file. The html file creates a webpage that holds UFO sighting data in a table that is designed to filter based on the following criteria:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

# Results
## Using the Search Criteria
Dana has created a step-by-step guide on accessing and adjusting the html file:

1. Open the [index.html](https://github.com/Sborresch/java_script/blob/main/UFOS/index.html) file in VSCode editor

2. Select "Go Live"

3. Scroll down to the "Filter Table" section

4. Insert any or all of the following UFO Sighting criteria into the input user boxes (Date, City, State, Country, Shape)

5. Click outside of the filter boxes to populate accurate data based on your search criteria

6. View the data table located in the html file to show you exact search data

7. Print page to store data for future use

# Summary
## Drawback
One drawback of this webpage is how it can be accessed. As it stands no URL has been created for this html webpage and therefore cannot be accessed externally. Only individuals who have access to the [index.html](https://github.com/Sborresch/java_script/blob/main/UFOS/index.html) file can make the webpage go live and access the data. 

## Recommendation 1 - External Access
It is recommended for Dana to provide access/ability for internet users to access this webpage and UFO sighting data by creaing a URL. Once the webpage is designed to Dana's taste and the functionality of the filter function is approved, it will provide value to external users.

## Recommendation 2 - Obtain Large Database
It is also recommended for Dana to gather a larger set of UFO sighting data to provide users/webpage visitors more information. The current [data.js](https://github.com/Sborresch/java_script/blob/main/UFOS/static/js/data.js) file only has roughly 200 records of UFO sighting. An enlarged database can include a larger date range or even expanded geographic locations, such as other continents and countries.
